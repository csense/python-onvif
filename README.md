# Bardi python onvif client

this python code will stream output from bardi cctv ip cam, then save it to your local disk 

low budget solution if you don't want to purchase their cloud membership plan :)

just replace the IP address accordingly, 101 for high resolution streaming, 102 for low resolution streaming
